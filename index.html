<p>This project was a Java coding project for my second year unit ADPROC. This was meant to introduce us to GUIs such as JAVASwing and was meant to get us to use inheritance and abstraction.</p>
<p>The goal for the project was to build a program for ordering lengths of pipe to a certain specification.</p>

<h3>Mark for the Coursework Assignment</h3>
<p>The mark give for this assignment was 62/100. There were a few reasons for this mark.</p>
<p>These reasons were:</p>
<h4>Positives</h4>
<ul>
	<li>It worked - It could accept inputs from a fully functioning GUI and then produce outputs.</li>
	<li>Marks awarded for other criteria.
</ul>
<h4>Negatives</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Incorrect calculation of price - One of the percentage multipliers was inputted incorrectly in the code. It should have been 12% but instead 17% was entered.</li>
	<li>Incorrect colour selection - Table 1. says which types of Pipe can have certain numbers of colours. We interpereted this incorrectly, we thought if you could have 2 colours you could also have one colour for the pipe. This was not the case, if the table said two colours it should only be two colours.</li>
	<li>Not information in errors output for the user. More information was needed when a user inputted something incorrectly or when thier input was invalid. The information needed to be more accurate.</li>
</ul>
