  "body": "### About this Project\r\nThis project was a Java coding project for my second year unit ADPROC. This was meant to introduce us to GUIs such as JAVASwing and was meant to get us to use inheritance and abstraction.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMain Author: Me - @awoodcroft95 - Anthony Woodcroft\r\nSecondary Author- @up733640 - Andrew Goshawk\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
